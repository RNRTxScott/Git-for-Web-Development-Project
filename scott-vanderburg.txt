Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    In line elements can kind of be moved around freely without creating breaks where as a block will always create those breaks in the page.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    That element is locked into a certain spacing from other blocks by using the distance to always keep it in the same place relative to the ancestor objects.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    div / h1 / footer , a / img , inline-block
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
    The box model shows from inside to outer of a css box from the padding to border to margin and then position, using all of these css is able to compute the coreect sizing.
    The "fix": was allowing the dev to change the widths individually from the other facets of the box.
